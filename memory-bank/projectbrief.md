# Project Brief: React Playground

## Project Purpose

This React Playground serves as a GitHub Template for our organization, enabling teams to rapidly prototype ideas in React using the latest versions of Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components. It provides a clean, modern starting point for building and iterating on new concepts without the complexity and dependencies of our production applications.

## Core Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- Modern, maintainable codebase using latest technologies (React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, ShadCN)
- Optimized development experience with Vite
- Responsive design by default
- Type-safe components and APIs
- Accessible UI components through ShadCN

### User Experience Requirements

- Easy to clone and start building immediately
- Well-documented components and patterns
- Intuitive project structure
- Minimal but complete setup

## Target Audience

- Internal development teams needing to prototype ideas quickly
- Developers wanting to experiment with new UI patterns
- Teams brainstorming new features without affecting production code

## Success Criteria

- Reduced time-to-prototype for new ideas (from days to hours)
- Consistent UI/UX across prototypes
- Separation from complex production app dependencies
- Increased experimentation and innovation through rapid prototyping
- Smooth transition path from prototype to production

## Constraints

- Must maintain compatibility with latest stable versions of React, Tailwind, and ShadCN
- Must be lightweight and focused on prototyping (not a full-featured application)
- Should follow organizational coding standards and best practices
- Must be accessible and responsive by default

## Scope

### In Scope

- React application setup with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
- ShadCN UI component integration
- Basic routing with React Router
- Example components and patterns
- Documentation for getting started

### Out of Scope

- Production deployment pipelines
- Backend integration
- Authentication systems
- Complex state management
- Performance optimization for large-scale applications

This project brief serves as the foundation for our React Playground GitHub Template, guiding all development decisions and ensuring the template meets the needs of our organization's teams.
