# Active Context: React Playground

This document captures the current state, recent changes, and active development focus of the React Playground template.

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on ensuring proper integration and configuration of Tailwind CSS v4, ShadCN UI components, and AI integration. This includes:

1. Resolving Tailwind CSS v4 configuration issues
2. Setting up the proper project structure for scalability
3. Documenting the template for easy onboarding
4. Creating example components to demonstrate usage patterns
5. Implementing AI integration with LLM providers

## Recent Changes

### API Request Handling Architecture

We've implemented a comprehensive solution for handling API requests in our React application:

1. **Express Server**: Set up an Express server to handle API requests in both development and production environments
2. **API Client Library**: Created a client-side library in src/lib/api/ to abstract away the details of making API requests
3. **Environment-specific Configuration**: Configured the API client to use different endpoints based on the environment
4. **AIWrapper Component**: Updated the AIWrapper component to use the new API client

This architecture provides several benefits:

- Solves CORS issues by proxying requests through the Express server
- Secures API keys by keeping them on the server side
- Provides a clean, consistent API for making requests
- Centralizes API request logic, making it easier to maintain and update

### ShadCN UI Configuration

We've successfully configured ShadCN UI with proper import aliases:

1. Updated TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json and tsconfig.app.json:

   ```json
   "compilerOptions": {
     "baseUrl": ".",
     "paths": {
       "@/*": ["./src/*"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Updated Vite configuration in vite.config.ts:

   ```typescript
   resolve: {
     alias: {
       '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
     },
   }
   ```

3. Initialized ShadCN UI with the CLI:

   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest init
   ```

4. Selected Slate as the base color for our design system

This configuration allows us to:

- Use the `@/` import alias in our code
- Add ShadCN UI components using the CLI
- Maintain consistent styling across the application

### Browser Title Management

We've implemented a solution for managing browser titles:

1. Created a custom HTML plugin in vite.config.ts to set the base title:

   ```typescript
   // Custom plugin to set the document title
   const htmlPlugin = () => {
     return {
       name: 'html-transform',
       transformIndexHtml(html: string) {
         return html.replace(/<title>(.*?)<\/title>/, '<title>React Playground | DFINITY</title>');
       },
     };
   };
   ```

2. Implemented a context-based approach for dynamic page titles:

   ```typescript
   // Special case for homepage
   if (pageTitle === 'Home') {
     document.title = baseTitle;
   }
   // For other pages, use the route name as prefix
   else if (pageTitle) {
     document.title = `${pageTitle} | ${baseTitle}`;
   }
   ```

3. This approach allows for:
   - Consistent base title across the application
   - Special handling for the homepage (no prefix)
   - Dynamic titles for other pages based on route names

### Tailwind CSS v4 Integration

We've recently updated the Tailwind CSS configuration to work with v4, which included:

1. Installing the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
2. Updating the PostCSS configuration to use the new package
3. Changing the Tailwind import syntax from directives to standard CSS imports:

   ```css
   /* Old approach */
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;

   /* New approach */
   @import 'tailwindcss';
   ```

4. Addressing compatibility issues with utility classes that have changed in v4

### Documentation Updates

We've enhanced the project documentation:

1. Added ShadCN UI Vite installation instructions to `memory-bank/official-documentation/shadcn.md`
2. Updated `.clinerules` with detailed instructions for adding ShadCN components
3. Updated progress tracking to reflect recent changes
4. Added API request handling architecture documentation

### Project Structure Setup

We've established a clear project structure:

- `/src/components/ui/` for ShadCN UI components
- `/src/components/` for custom components
- `/src/pages/` for page components
- `/src/lib/` for utility functions and context providers
- `/src/lib/api/` for API client library
- `/memory-bank/` for project documentation

### Documentation

We're actively documenting the project to ensure it's easy for teams to use:

1. Creating comprehensive memory bank documentation
2. Adding inline code comments
3. Setting up example components with usage documentation
4. Documenting architectural decisions and patterns

## Active Decisions

### API Request Handling Strategy

We're using a hybrid approach to API request handling:

1. Express server for handling API requests in both development and production
2. Client-side API library for abstracting away the details of making requests
3. Environment-specific configuration for different endpoints
4. Secure handling of API keys on the server side

This approach provides security, flexibility, and maintainability.

### CSS Organization Strategy

We're using a hybrid approach to CSS:

1. Tailwind utility classes for most styling needs
2. Component-specific CSS files for complex components
3. Global styles in `globals.css` for base styling
4. CSS variables for theming and design tokens

This approach provides flexibility while maintaining consistency.

### Component API Design

For component APIs, we're following these principles:

1. Props should have sensible defaults
2. Components should be composable
3. Use TypeScript for type safety
4. Follow accessibility best practices
5. Support common variants through props

### Project Template Configuration

We're configuring the project as a GitHub Template with:

1. Clear documentation for getting started
2. Example components that demonstrate best practices
3. Pre-configured tooling (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)
4. Minimal dependencies to keep the template lightweight
